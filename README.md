# FineCookingArchivePythonClient
An alternative, Python-based client for the now defunct 1994-2015 Fine Cooking Archive

The archive is tough to find these days, but may be able to be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Fine-Cooking-2015-Magazine-Archive/dp/1631865978/). The name on the box is *Fine Cooking Magazine Archive 1994 to 2015*.
